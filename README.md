## About me

I'm a Software Engineer at [Joyent](https://www.joyent.com) working on
[Triton](https://github.com/joyent/triton) and
[SmartOS](https://www.joyent.com/smartos). I work remotely from the
[city](https://www.cob.org/) with the [least sunshine in the United States](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/connelly/article/Bellingham-tops-list-of-cities-with-least-sunshine-4954055.php). When I'm not working on technology related things, I'm
likely out mountain biking, running, or wakeboarding.
